Ultrasound and MRI Expertise, Signal Processing, Software Engineering

I'm a software engineer with expertise in medical imaging. I like to develop software
to control the device, to design pulse sequences, signal processing and image reconstruction algorithms, and to 
implement them on a high performance GPU.
Bonus points if your company uses [Julia](https://julialang.org)!
